# COMP90051 Project1

The goal of the Project is to develop skills in researching and applying methods from subareas of Statistical
Machine Learning (SML) that may be unfamiliar, by leveraging the fundamental knowledge built in lectures and
workshops. Our goal is for students completing COMP90051 to gain experience “upskilling” in SML so that they
will continue to learn about SML long after their university studies complete. The Project accomplishes this by
challenging students with a difficult learning task: predicting authors of test tweets from among a very large
number of authors found in training tweets. The Project also builds generic skills in problem solving, critical
analysis, presentation/communication, and team work – all critical for practical SML.
